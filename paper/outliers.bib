abstract = {This article describes the development of a new technique for identifying outlier coefficients in meta-analytic data sets. Denoted as the sample-adjusted meta-analytic deviancy statistic or SAMD, this technique takes into account the sample size on which each study is based when determining outlier status. An empirical test of the SAMD statistic with an actual meta-analytic data set resulted in a substantial reduction in residual variabilities and a corresponding increase in the percentage of variance accounted for by statistical artifacts after removal of outlier study coefficients. Moreover, removal of these coefficients helped to clarify what was a confusing and difficult-to-explain finding in this meta-analysis. It is suggested that analysis for outliers become a routine part of meta-analysis methodology. Limitations and directions for future research are discussed.

@article{Coin2008,
abstract = {Statistical models are often based on normal distributions and procedures for testing this distributional assumption are needed. Many goodness-of-fit tests suffer from the presence of outliers, in the sense that they may reject the null hypothesis even in the case of a single extreme observation. We show a possible extension of the Shapiro-Wilk test that is not affected by such a problem. The presented method is inspired by the forward search (FS), a new, recently proposed, diagnostic tool. An application to univariate observations shows how the procedure is able to capture the structure of the data, even in the presence of outliers. Other properties are also investigated.

@article{Anscombe1960,
abstract = {If one reading is a long way from the rest in a series of replicate determinations, or if in a least-squares analysis one reading is found to have a much greater residual than the others, there is temptation to reject it as spurious. Numerous criteria for the rejection of outliers have been proposed and discussed during the past 100 years. They seem always to have been regarded as something like significance tests, and attention has been focussed on rejection rates. It is suggested that rejection rules are not significance tests but insurance policies, and attention would be better focussed on error variance. A detailed study is made of the effect of routine application of rejection criteria to replicate determinations of a single value. Determinations in triplicate and quadruplicate are especially considered. Complex patterns of observations are also considered, especially factorial arrangements with high symmetry, and there is a study of the correlations between residuals. Attention is focussed mainly on rejection rules appropriate when the population variance is known, but some consideration is also given to Studentized rules.},

This article discusses and interrelates the following four diagnostics that are useful in identifying outliers: studentized residuals, the hat elements, Cook's distance, and Mahalanobis distance. Guidelines are given for interpretation of the diagnostics. Outliers will not necessarily be influential in affecting the regression coefficients. This important fact is illustrated and emphasized.},

We look at the quantitative effect of outliers on estimators and test statistics based on normal theory maximum likelihood and the asymptotically distribution-free procedures. Even if a proposed structure is correct for the majority of the data in a sample, a small proportion of outliers leads to biased estimators and significant test statistics. An especially unfortunate consequence is that the power to reject a model can be made arbitrarily--but misleadingly--large by inclusion of outliers in an analysis.},

@article{Shaari2009,
abstract = {An outlier in a dataset is a point or a class of points that is considerably dissimilar to or inconsistent with the remainder of the data. Detection of outliers is important for many applications and has always attracted attention among data mining research community. In this paper, a new method in detecting outlier based on Rough Sets Theory is proposed. The main concept of using the Rough Sets for outlier detection is to discover Non-Reduct from the information system (IS). Non-Reduct is a set of attributes from IS that may contain outliers. It is discovered through the computation of Non-Reduct by defining Indiscernibility matrix modulo (iDMM D) and Indiscernibility function modulo (iDFM D). A measurement called RSetOF (Rough Set Outlier Factor Value) is hereby defined to identify and detect outlier objects. Extensive experiments were conducted where ten benchmark datasets were tested with the proposed method. To evaluate the effectiveness of performance of the proposed method, RSetAlg is compared to the Frequent Pattern (FindFPOF) method. The experimental result reveals that the approach utilised is a good outlier detection method compared to FindFPOF method. Thus, this proposed method has formed a novel and competitive method in outlier detection. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2010 APA, all rights reserved) (journal abstract)},
